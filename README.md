# Applications of Machine Learning Across Various Domains

**Overview:** Machine learning (ML) -  is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that allow computers to learn from and make decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed for each task, ML systems improve their performance by analyzing patterns and insights in large datasets.

## Diagnostics that Predictive in Healthcare

* **Problem Being Solved:**

 **For Healthcare Systems** - making significant strides in healthcare, improving both diagnostics and treatment. ML models can predict patient outcomes based on historical data. For instance, they can forecast which patients are at high risk of developing conditions like heart disease or diabetes, enabling early intervention and personalized treatment plans.

 In this example, a decision tree classifier is used to infer from a dataset if a patient has diabetes or not.
