# Applications of Machine Learning Across Various Domains

**Overview:** Machine learning (ML) -  is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that allow computers to learn from and make decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed for each task, ML systems improve their performance by analyzing patterns and insights in large datasets.

## Diagnostics that Predictive in Healthcare

* **Problem Being Solved:**

 **For Healthcare Systems** - making significant strides in healthcare, improving both diagnostics and treatment. ML models can predict patient outcomes based on historical data. For instance, they can forecast which patients are at high risk of developing conditions like heart disease or diabetes, enabling early intervention and personalized treatment plans.

 In this example, a decision tree classifier is used to infer from a dataset if a patient has diabetes or not.

 * **Type of Machine Learning Used:**

Supervised learning - is commonly used in healthcare for tasks where historical data with known outcomes is available. The model learns from this labeled data to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data.

* **Impact of the Solution:**

Early Diagnosis:

Benefit: Patients are identified earlier, allowing for timely intervention, lifestyle changes, and preventive measures.
Outcome: Early management can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes and reduce the risk of complications.


## **Finance Fraud Detection**

**Problem Being Solved:**
ML significantly enhances the ability to detect and prevent credit card fraud by leveraging sophisticated algorithms that analyze transaction data for unusual patterns, adapting to new fraud strategies, and providing real-time insights to protect against financial losses.

In this example, a basic dataset is subjected to K-means clustering to identify possible fraud.
